Nation Builder is a radical and fun new way to run your country, state, city, neighborhood, corporation or non-profit completely democratically with thousands of people over the internet. 

You can see it in action at White House 2: http://whitehouse2.org/

Nation Builder is coded with Ruby on Rails 2.2, and is in active development.  It's not packaged up all nice and neat yet, it's still a bit raw from that perspective.  If you are interested in using this right away, please contact me on github so I can help you through any issues that crop up installing it.  My email address is also here: http://3DNA.us/
