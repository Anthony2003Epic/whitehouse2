Nation Builder is a radical and fun new way to run your country, state, city, neighborhood, corporation or non-profit completely democratically with thousands of people over the internet. 

This project started as White House 2 (http://whitehouse2.org/), but it's now expanding into NationBuilder so anyone can use it.  I will be launching a web service version of this in mid-June that will make forming your own government as technically easy as setting up a Blogger blog or a Ning social network.

My blog has a bit more on the goals:

Nation Builder is coded with Ruby on Rails 2.2, and is in active development.  It's not packaged up all nice and neat yet, it's still a bit raw from that perspective.  If you've never built a Ruby on Rails application before, this may not be the right place to start.  It is released under the MIT License, the same as Ruby on Rails.

Completely incomplete installation instructions:

install rails 2.2.2
install various gems (check environment.rb)
install memcached
install sphinx

git clone git://github.com/jgilliam/nationbuilder.git
git submodule init
git submodule update

Configure config/database.yml for your database server and remove the .dist.  You should also change the session_key and secret_key to something unique.

Now we need to do a little workaround for a bug in Thinking Sphinx, the search engine plugin.  You cannot load the database schema up until you've commented out the "define_index" blocks in three files:

app/models/product.rb
app/models/document.rb 
app/models/priority.rb  

Create and load the database:

rake db:create
rake db:schema:load
rake single:start

Now go back into those three files and put the "define_index" blocks back.

Remove the .dist from the various config files in config/ and configure them appropriately

config/nb.yml -- for facebook template ids and twitter account info
config/amazon_fps.yml -- not used right now, but will soon
config/contacts.yml -- for the contact importer
config/facebooker.yml -- for facebook integration
config/newrelic.yml -- for new relic

add cron jobs based on the example in config/crontab.dist
