Nation Builder is a radical and fun new way to run your country, state, city, neighborhood, corporation or non-profit completely democratically with thousands of people over the internet. 


You can see it in action at White House 2: http://whitehouse2.org/

Nation Builder is coded with Ruby on Rails 2.2, and is in active development.  It's not packaged up all nice and neat yet, it's still a bit raw from that perspective.  If you've never built a Ruby on Rails application before, this may not be the right place to start.  It is released under the MIT License, the same as Ruby on Rails.
