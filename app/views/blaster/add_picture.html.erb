Dear <%= @user.name %>,

Good news!  <%= @tag.name.titleize %> will be featured on This Week at White House 2, our short YouTube show every Sunday.

Check out past episodes on my YouTube channel here:

Anyway, the reason I'm emailing you is because now is a good time to get your best comments in to possibly be featured in the show.  Short, interesting, and factual is good.  Personal stories are even better.

Join the discussion here: 
<%= @root_url %>priorities/286-let-banks-that-make-bad-loans-go-out-of-business/discussions?utm_source=issue_featured&utm_medium=email

And if you upload a picture of yourself, I'll be more likely to feature your comment.
<%= @root_url %>users/<%= @user.to_param %>/picture?utm_source=issue_featured&utm_medium=email

Then check your email (or the YouTube channel) on Sunday to tune in.

Thanks for being involved.
