This project started as "White House 2":http://whitehouse2.org/, where we imagined how the White House could work if it was run completely democratically by thousands of people over the internet. It's coded with Ruby on Rails 2.3.2, and released under the MIT License, the same as Ruby on Rails. 

I am supporting the update of the code so that it will run in today's computing environments.
